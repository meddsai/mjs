## Architectural Overview

MJS follows a modular, microservices-based architecture where each major component operates independently while cooperating to form a cohesive system.

### Key Features
- **Service Independence**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Technology Agnostic**: Each service uses the best-suited technology for its purpose
- **Containerized**: Docker-based deployment for consistency and portability
- **Automated Workflows**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for quality assurance

## Core Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Each service is self-contained
- Independent codebases and dependencies
- Separate build and deployment processes
- Service-specific configuration management

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Frontend: User interface and client-side logic
- Backend: Core business logic and data management
- AI Service: Machine learning and data processing
- Documentation: Comprehensive guides and specifications
- Infrastructure: Deployment and orchestration

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Service-specific testing strategies
- Independent security scanning
- Automated code quality checks
- Comprehensive documentation requirements

## Service Architecture

### Frontend Service
```
frontend/
├── src/             # Application source code
├── public/          # Static assets
├── tests/           # Test suites
├── Dockerfile       # Container definition
└── package.json     # Dependencies and scripts
```
**Technology Stack**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
**Primary Responsibilities**:
- User interface rendering
- Client-side state management
- API integration
- User interaction handling

### Backend Service
```
backend/
├── src/             # Application source code
├── tests/           # Test suites
├── Dockerfile       # Container definition
└── Cargo.toml       # Dependencies and configuration
```
**Technology Stack**: Rust, SQLx, Actix-web
**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Business logic implementation
- Data persistence
- API endpoints
- Authentication/Authorization

### AI Service
```

├── src/             # Application source code
├── tests/           # Test suites
├── Dockerfile       # Container definition
└── pyproject.toml   # Dependencies and configuration
```
**Technology Stack**: Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, PyTorch
**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Machine learning model serving
- Data processing
- AI-powered features
- Model training and evaluation

## Inter-Service Communication

### Current Implementation
- RESTful APIs between services
- JSON-based data exchange
- HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Service-specific endpoints

### Areas for Enhancement
1. **API Contracts**
   - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
   - Version management
   - Type sharing between services

2. **Service Discovery**
   - Service registry implementation
   - Health checking
   - Load balancing

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error formats
   - Error propagation
   - Retry mechanisms

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Service-specific development servers
2. Docker Compose for multi-service testing
3. Hot-reloading capabilities
4. Independent debugging

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests per service
2. Integration tests between services
3. End-to-end testing
4. Performance testing

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Automated builds
2. Multi-stage testing
3. Security scanning
4. Containerized deployment

## Future Improvements

### Short-term Goals
1. **API Gateway**
   - Centralized routing
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Request/Response transformation

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Centralized logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Service health monitoring

3. **Development Experience**
   - Improved local development setup
   - Shared development utilities
   - Cross-service debugging tools

### Long-term Goals
1. **Service Mesh**
   - Advanced service discovery
   - Traffic management
   - Security policies
   - Observability

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Message queues
   - Event sourcing
   - CQRS patterns
   - Real-time updates

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Zero-trust architecture
   - Service-to-service authentication
   - Secrets management
   - Security automation

## Extensibility & Plugin Architecture

MJS is designed for extensibility. (Planned) plugin/module system will allow developers to add custom features, integrations, and UI components without modifying the core. Plugins will be able to:
- Register new API endpoints
- Add UI components or pages
- Hook into workflow events
- Extend data models

See [PLUGINS.md](./PLUGINS.md) for details and roadmap.

## API-First Design & Versioning

All core functionality is exposed via RESTful APIs, documented with OpenAPI/Swagger. API versioning ensures backward compatibility. See [API.md](./API.md) for standards, endpoint documentation, and extension guidelines.

## Error Handling & Logging

- Centralized logging for all services (see [MONITORING.md](./MONITORING.md))
- Consistent error formats (JSON)
- Error propagation and retry mechanisms
- Logs are accessible via Docker/Kubernetes and can be shipped to external systems (e.g., ELK, Grafana)

## Internationalization/Localization

MJS aims to support multiple locales for both UI and content. See [INTERNATIONALIZATION.md](./INTERNATIONALIZATION.md) for how to add new languages and localize content.

## Contributing

When contributing to the architecture:

1. **Maintain Modularity**
   - Keep services independent
   - Avoid shared state
   - Use well-defined interfaces

2. **Document Changes**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Provide architectural diagrams
   - Explain design decisions

3. **Consider Impact**
   - Evaluate effects on other services
   - Assess scaling implications
   - Consider security implications
