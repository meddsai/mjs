# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Authentication with Keycloak
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Keycloak integration for OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication
# Details:
Deploy Keycloak using Docker. Configure realms, clients, and roles for the journal system. Implement authentication middleware in the Rust backend to validate JWT tokens. Create login, registration, and profile management flows in the frontend. Implement role-based access control for API endpoints. Set up secure session management and token refresh mechanisms. Configure social login providers if required.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration and login flows. Verify token validation and refresh mechanisms. Test role-based access control with different user types. Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures.
