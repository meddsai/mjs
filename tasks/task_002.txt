# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment
# Details:
Create GitHub Actions or GitLab CI configuration files to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. Configure linting, unit testing, and build steps. Set up deployment targets for development, staging, and production environments. Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks. Configure automated dependency updates and security scanning.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CI pipeline by making test commits and ensuring all steps run successfully. Test deployment to development environment. Validate that failed tests properly prevent merges to protected branches.
