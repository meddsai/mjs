# Title: Configure Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
# Status: not_started
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting for system health and performance
# Details:
Deploy Prometheus and Grafana using Docker. Configure metrics collection from all services (frontend, backend, databases, etc.). Create custom dashboards for system health, performance, and business metrics. Set up alerting rules for critical issues. Implement logging aggregation with ELK stack or similar. Create runbooks for common issues. Configure uptime monitoring and SLO tracking. Set up performance benchmarking tools.

# Test Strategy:
Verify metrics collection from all services. Test alerting by simulating failure conditions. Validate dashboard accuracy with controlled load testing. Ensure proper log aggregation and search functionality.
