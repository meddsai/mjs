# Task ID: 9
# Title: Set up AI/ML Service with FastAPI
# Status: in_progress
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement Python-based AI/ML service for peer review matching and recommendations
# Details:
Create a Python FastAPI project for AI/ML services. Implement Docker configuration for the service. Develop peer review matching algorithms based on expertise and interests. Create citation analysis and recommendation services. Implement API endpoints for integration with the main backend. Set up model training and evaluation pipelines. Configure caching with Redis for performance optimization. Document API interfaces and model behaviors.

# Test Strategy:
Develop unit tests for ML algorithms. Test API endpoints with realistic data. Evaluate recommendation quality with standard metrics. Measure performance and response times. Test integration with the main backend services.
