# Modern Journal System (MJS) Product Requirements Document

## Overview
MJS is a modern, open-source journal system designed for academic publishing. It aims to provide a powerful, extensible, and user-friendly platform for developers, researchers, and journal editors.

## Key Features
- **Modern UI**: Responsive, accessible interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **AI-Powered Search**: Smart recommendations and full-text search capabilities.
- **High-Performance Backend**: Rust (Actix Web) for secure, scalable APIs.
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Support for plugins and custom modules.
- **Easy Deployment**: Docker-based setup for local and production environments.
- **Robust Security**: OAuth2/OpenID Connect (Keycloak), HTTPS-ready, secure session management.
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support for global journals.

## Architecture Overview
MJS follows a modular, microservices-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (Next.js) — user interface, SSR, SEO.
- **Backend**: Rust (Actix Web) — REST API, business logic, authentication.
- **AI/ML Service**: Python (FastAPI) — peer review matching, citation analysis, recommendations.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL — structured, reliable data storage.
- **File Storage**: MinIO — scalable object storage for PDFs and media.
- **Search**: Meilisearch — fast, typo-tolerant article search.
- **Caching**: Redis — performance optimization for frequent queries.
- **Authentication**: Keycloak — OAuth2, OpenID Connect.
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes — scalable, portable infrastructure.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana — system health and performance.
- **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD.

   - Performance Testing.
   - Validation.

6. **Phase 6 (Months 30-36)**: Deployment and Rollout
   - Staging Deployment.
   - Production Preparation.
   - Production Rollout.

## Risk Management
- **Technical Risks**: Performance bottlenecks, data migration issues, integration challenges, security vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Regular backups, comprehensive testing, phased rollout, monitoring and alerting, rollback procedures.

## Success Metrics
- Performance metrics to be defined based on user feedback and system requirements.
